Location services are always on for no reason
I used to like using Uber a lot when it first came out and thought it better than Lyft but now i find myself constantly using Lyft after repeatedly waiting for Uber drivers who would constantly go the other direction from where they should be picking me up. Not only that now Uber wing pick me up at my requested location but will default to a nearby street which becomes inconvenient especially when the weather is bad. Lyft has no such problems and the cost is comparable. Uber please fix your gps and business model
Twice I've been taken  on a wild goose chase and I had to tell the driver where to go he said he was following the Uber GPS which was taking him all over the place for no reason at all I don't have time to drive around !!please update your GPS system thank you
I will not be using this app anymore. Because I declined letting the app keep tracking my location even while I am not using the app, it is now next to useless. Good thing I still have Lyft installed, because with Uber there is not an option in the privacy tab in the phone's Settings app for setting the tracking of location "Only While Using", like there is for other apps (Including Lyft).
This app has revolutionized the cab experience for me.  I'll never go back. Inexpensive, safe, reliable, convenient -- simply an amazing app that's revolutionizing transportation in cities globally.
Why does the app need access to location even when not in use? Apple allows for granular privacy settings and uber WAS using them before, and they switched it to always needing location, poor choice. 

Also, this app is HUGE. Lyft is half the size.
I needed a ride so I downloaded the app and signed up in advance. The very first time I tried it, it said my account was banned. I tried restarting and trying again and it still didn't work. I have never uber-ed in the past or ever signed up for an account so I have no idea what happened. I downloaded Lyft and was picked up in two minutes. I will never try uber again.
Always saving me from getting late to work or school! Good prices and good service, thanks just for being there and have this amazing idea for technology transportation. 😎
What changes in each update
App explanation talks about needing location when the app is open. But the new update requires location access always, not only when the app is open. Until this is fixed, Uber won't be getting any business from me.
The fact that you can't tip the drivers through the app is absolutely retarded. Seriously UBER- this has been a complaint with everybody forever. Get with it already. So stupid.
Uber continues its downward spiral and has lost my trust. The perpetual location tracking in the recent versions is totally unacceptable. Making matters worse, they have *removed* the option to use iOS's native privacy controls to allow location tracking only while using the app. Lyft respects users' privacy, unlike Uber. Also, I'm no longer able to rate drivers, since after turning off location tracking there's a nag screen every time one opens or returns to the app, and that nag screen blocks the page where typically one would rate the driver right after a trip (dismissing the nag screen also dismissed the rating screen, which is a major design flaw). Uber has officially gone from hit-and-miss to terrible. And, on top of that, now Uber wants access to your contacts as well as your location. Pass.
I strongly suspect this app of tracking my location even though I have turned off location services for it. Since Uber gives you the option of always tracking your location or never tracking your location I chose to never let it track my location. But, when I am somewhere new typing in an address to be picked up at I typically enter one or two digits of the address and, woah and behold, Uber suggests to exact address I am standing in front of. This has happened to me in multiple states. Sure seems like Uber is tracking my location without my permission.
Was charged multiple fees for my driver picking up the wrong person and then 8 cancelled a trip because the other guy was going to take 20 minutes to reach me. Instead of my money back they credited the account.
GPS always on why? Stop tracking me.
App stopped allowing me to call a car. Contacted support as this was an Uber issue, but they were mostly deaf to the problem. A shame... I got a congratulations on my six year soon the same day. Numerous emails and screenshots, but ultimately no help. I have been Lyfting as a result.
Missing the option to schedule an Uber after the recent update.
Drivers picks up the wrong people a block away and their customer support still feels it is appropriate to charge me for the ride instead... just lovely
Requesting a ride always pairs me with a driver farther than necessary / farther than the cars nearest me. I know this is an issue because the app was not like this before. This has been a problem for a few weeks/months now, so I'm not sure why this still hasn't been addressed.
Wants 24/7 access to gps location -  not just when using the app. KNOCK IT OFF WITH THE SPYWARE. Give us back the "when using app" option.
There is absolutely no reason that you need to have my location services always available. None. Switch back to "when using app" and I will go back to five stars.
Location services option needs to go back to switch on only when using app. There's no reason to "Always" require sharing my location. Lyft doesn't have this problem. Keep updating to clear the bad reviews out everyone's just going to keep reposting them. Not sure why apple even allows this.. without actual and proper updates reviews shouldn't be cleared.
Please give us proper update details.
Too often there is a download. All you're doing is wasting space on my phone by constantly updating. Going to try lyft. Maybe their updates are necessary ones.
So try Lyft.
Uber does not let me use PNC bank cards for some odd apparent reason. My card only works on occasion, and right now it is not working on the Uber app. They need to fix this problem ASAP.
Never came for my pregnant wife looking to go to hospital while I was at work and charged her for not showing up while she was outside waiting. Never use them again LFYT for now on.
I have been using the app since November 2016, I have not had a problem with any updates or the app itself. Very responsive and GPS is as accurate as any other app I use.
New update forced user to share location at all time (always). Bad move. Make sure to turn it off and just manually enter address to use the app.
Devs: Please give option to use location while using app, instead of always.
When you search the airport of your city, check the route carefully because possibly the destination is set to the middle of a runway and the route is several miles longer than it should be. As a result, you're paying $4~$6 extra for the distance you won't travel. I reported to Uber several month ago and never heard back.

And, do they think people are used to the "Always on" location tracking? No reason for me to allow them to track my location 5 minutes after drop off, and no reason to trust them only doing what the claimed to do.

And, people like me still haven't forgotten that Uber requested hundreds of Lyft cars then cancelled them and did so again and again. What a mean company.

Not that I'm still using this app. In fact, I have not used it ever since I found the overcharging trap. Not to mention the location tracking. I'm just keeping this app installed so that I can get back and leave a 1-star review whenever it is updated.
Apps are getting more and more intricate in their design, but is unfortunately causing them to become larger and larger in file size. The latest update has this app at over 200mb! Streamline the app and make it smaller/faster and it will earn more stars. Also allow users to turn off the tracking after drivers drop people off.
Just hate those apps that does not even bother to write a change log in their version update and yet ask the users to rate and check back for new features.
TRASH!! Left me stranded for two hours at a Baltimore bus station at 3 am because of app glitches! Horrible and will never use again
Background tracking all the time. Super sketchy company. Don't use.
Why so big?  Seriously this is a Transit app, not Wikipedia. How about trying to optimize it a little?  Seems to be going up by 10mb/week now.
Two drivers arrived at our pick up address, parked a few houses down so that they could check our destination (they don't know where they are taking you until they arrive at the pick up address). They then decided to cancel our ride to the airport. As a result we were over an hour late and missed our flight. Uber customer service's response was rude and they refused to acknowledge responsibility or otherwise offer any compensation. Saving $20 compared to a professional taxi service cost us over $1000 in rebooking costs. Think twice before you trust Uber.
I will never again use their service.  I used it for the first and last time.  I scheduled a pick up for my son and his friends (teenagers).  The driver was a few minutes early from the scheduled pick up time.  After the driver called me, I called my son.  Well let's just say that the driver pulled off exactly 5 minutes from the time he called me as my son and friends were walking towards the car.  That shows me that an uber ride is unreliable.
This app is worst than Lyft and it needs a f***** update real quick! Also using my location when I'm not using the service, really? I'm surprise uber hasn't gone out of business already!!
I have switched to Lyft simply because of the always on location tracking?  Not sure why Uber even needs this but shady culture plus always on tracking equals #deleteuber
This app makes no sense. Let's charge passengers more and drivers less. All these five stars are probably from the uber company. Rating will go back up once they care for the drivers.
This update is terrible, app got slow, navigation is bad
At a rest stop on a turnpike and the app won't let anyone pick me up. I can't because it's not an address according to uber. But they wouldn't tell me that, just kept canceling drivers. Now I got charged $5 for never receiving services. No reply, just kept changing drivers without giving them my proper address. Never using app again #LocalTaxi
Seems to work well after my first ride, if you use my code we both benefit joes41051ue
Uses my location when I'm not in the app
App tracks location in background. Company doesn't have a very good record with tracking users.
Inconsistent pricing, incompetent customer support team. Lyft has 10% off rides right now - will be transitioning to them!
Uber used to be my favorite. Newest version wants to know you're location all the time even when not using the app which doesn't make sense. I will be switching to lyft
Living in a large city with high rises, you are never located on the map properly. This update brings a terrible way to pick your current location. You have to put in your destination, then it automatically selects your current location. You then have to select your current location to drop the pin. Not a major problem I suppose, but really annoying when an app takes 1 step forward and 2 steps back. This will be pretty annoying in urban areas to jump through the extra hoops when Lyft just lets you move the pickup location immediately.

Update 6 months later. Last three days Uber has sent the drivers on a wild goose chase through alleys to pick me up in Chicago. Permanently switching to Lyft who hasn't don't that yet.
Uber CEO get your stuff together.. Put your users interest always first.
I would never allow an app to always track my location even if it provided something super convenient for me, but allowing Uber to always track without it bringing any upside to the user is just a stupid move. Lfyt finally arrived in my city and im only using them from now on.
Location always on = uber always deleted.
I have been left by numerous drivers and still charged for the rides. I was told that I will be reimbursed and never received not 1 refund.
I tried adding a new card. Uber won't let me request rides unless I scan my card, but the card scanner doesn't work!
There is no reason for you to have access to your user's location all the time! Big privacy issue.
The updates will log you out and won't log in anymore for some reasons. It's very frustrating especially you are trying to catch a quick ride to the airport. Why should I use this piece of junk while I can grab a yellow cap literally in 1 second in NYC? Also the location tracking even after deletion is utterly disgusting...
Uber drivers is always canceling 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 to lyft i goo... 🖕🏿
And super rude drivers 80% of the time. Plus, lots of bugs with the app. Use Lyft instead even if it's a dollar more- it's worth it.
You know if I wanna go somewhere and I get uber it means I need to get there soon.. don't assign a driver that's 14 minutes away and don't charge me when I try to cancel ... I need to be there on time not 14 minutes late!
Learn a thing or two from Lyft!
Terrible on privacy
I can't even get picked up by Uber now! Uber's latest app DOES NOT FUNCTION without full access to location services at all times! I've been extremely happy with Lyft's prices and drivers lately though, and Juno is an even better option if it's available in your area.
Messages are not getting through to the drivers in México City.
Why is this app even on top charts it has bad ratings and every one says lyft is better why??
Dishonest company. Use Lyft or any alternative instead.
Tired of driving around in circles -when I'm two seconds away from my destination we go pick up someone else.
The new version requires access to your location even when you are not using the app/the app is not running. That wastes battery and violates your privacy.

There is no longer an option to have Uber use your location only when you are using the app - you are either forced to let them track you all the time, or to disable it from using your location entirely and enter all addresses by hand (which is a pain because you get a lot of wrong autocompletes that aren't even in the same state)
I spent 5 minutes figuring out an error with the app in order for it to work
Sometimes confusing but it works!
I requested an Uber , the driver never picked me up and I was charged $10.90 for I ride I didn't take. Uber refused to give me a refund!
How do I give this LESS THAN 1 star? I verified the address of the place where I was (because I wasn't at home), typed it into the app, saw the little car moving; however the driver didn't come to the right place. Now I am wondering why I ordered Uber in the first place. What a waste of time and energy!
The app crashes very often
Promo code for first time use didn't work. I've tried twice now. Last time I just gave up and used Lyft. Now I'm stuck and have to uber home from the airport. First and last time I'm using this service.
Had two Drivers cancel on me because there was a surge that continued to rise- I waited a total of 10 min for both before I finally hopped in a cab. Dishonest company with dishonest and sketchy practices
I will not upgrade until Uber restores the option to track me only when using the app.  If the older version I am on stops working before that change, I will switch to Lyft.
Get your money's worth at LYFT guys. UBER is disorganized, a waste of time, and a pain in your pockets. APP IS NOT efficient. Speaking through horrible experiences. (Not the drivers fault). Matches me with new drivers at the last minute, causing me to be late after already waited the Estimated Time. Waste of money because of the high cancellation rates. GPS is horrible causing the drivers never to reach the destination. I only try UBER again because their cheaper BUT ITS NOT WORTH IT. LYFT has a higher price for their efficiency, great service and organization. Sorry UB'z.
App repeatedly fails and the customer service when trying to correct the issue was absolutely horrendous.  I would just use lyft.
Uber charges you $5 after waiting 5 minutes to cancel a trip. Fair enough. I cancel a trip when an Uber driver doesn't show up after waiting for them for 10+ minutes. Was charged $5 even though driver didn't show up. Tried to get compensated by contacting customer service but they claim that charge was 'appropriate'. Uber, you need to waive fees for riders who are WAITING for MISSING drivers.
The app bogs down my phone. Remind me of playing a video game with very little system resources. Choppy and overall junk. 

The functionality is fine, but speed of functionality is not.
I am an Uber frequent user, and have been for many months.  It had worked fine until these past three weeks with one of their updates.  Now the App just doesn't work.  It doesn't track the vehicle accurately.  It suggests routes on streets going the wrong way.  It does not allow drivers to use Waze.  The in-app messaging feature doesn't work.  It either never reaches the driver or just disappears before the driver can fully read it.  The option of contacting the driver via phone doesn't work and connects to non-existent numbers.  In summary, go back to the previous version that worked so well.  This version is a nightmare and will drive customers like myself to look for other options... and there are many out there.
App does not always show current location of travel. Uber sends multiple emails for receipts after signing up for this. App provides no way to provide feedback about app issues except here.
They overcharged me and have no phone number to contact them with. Through messages I had to negotiate to get them to bring the cost back down which at that point I felt should have been a free ride for all the ridiculousness that it was. Switching to Lyft.
There is still no way to only enable location sharing only when using the app.

Having location sharing on all the time is a deal breaker for me.

Uber: Re enable the option to only share when using the app.
Update: This review will be posted every time there is a "bug fix" update that doesn't do anything other than remove bad reviews until their stance on unnecessarily tracking riders changes. 

There's absolutely no reason for Uber to track my location AFTER the ride is over. I do not want to share my location with Uber all the time, but now that's the only way to use the app. It's a completely sketchy move that does not benefit the user in any way. You can have an incredibly accurate, reliable app with the "Only While Using" location services option. 

The only real reason I can see for this is Uber wants to track user movements and sell the analytics to the highest bidder, which is deplorable.
I literally had the worst experience with uber tonight in my life. I have used this app for two years now. And after this experience, I probably will never use this app again.. after typing in my home address it took me to a different location. My poor uber driver- it was his first ride ever and that happened. I can't imagine the stress it caused him after knowing how annoying it was for me.
Every time i have tried to use uber it just does not work
After inputting your name and a photo, you cannot go back and change it. Before, you could change your name and profile picture, but now the options to update this are non existent. This can be troublesome for someone who has had a legal name change or looks different than in their original picture, both applying to my case. 

Not only this, but the location services are on even when you aren't using the app, which is an invasion of privacy and unneeded.
Stop tracking my location always. Uber does not need it. The app is bad now and does not open properly sometimes. I'd like to see the ability to rate other customers that I share an uber pool with.
Absolutely useless. The app won't open my 2017 iPad 5 running iOS version 10.3.2. Garbage!
(ﾉಠдಠ)ﾉ︵┻━┻
So on Wi-Fi I use Uber and if I'm not on Wi-Fi then I'm forced to use left please fix this bug
Are you serious? Uber is going down. Uber is not trustworthy nor safe.
I am a frequent user
This may seem small but I really do not the feature that allows drivers to rate their passengers. I got a bad rating for something that wasn't even my fault. There is no point in having that feature. I don't work for Uber. Remove this please!!
What happened to allowing location services only when this app is running?  How is it a good thing to let UBER drain my phone battery by always having my location?

I'm switching to Lyft until UBER changes this.

12/30/16
They're still doing it.  I'll keep checking and updating my review.

2/11/17
Uber is still a stalker.

3/2/17
Uber is still a battery sucking stalker.

3/10/17
Another update, still no change.  Updating this review is starting to become an outlet for my disappointment.

3/29/17
Yup.  UBER still done nothing to fix this.

4/6/17
UBER is still a 1 star battery sucking stalker app.  I'm sticking with LYFT

4/14/17
Another wasted UBER update, they still want my battery life.

5/1/17
Another update, no change.  Funny thing... LYFT has majority 5 star rating... hmmm

5/16/17
Several updates later, no change, still happy using LYFT.  I gunna give it a few months before I check again.
Like it
I don't want the always tracking in my location services. It drains the battery and makes me into a massive metadata point. Also don't crash after major events.
Why?  There is no reason to track. E when app is not beIng used.
They had charged me 3 times in 1 day when I didn't even request them and had the nerve to then charge me a cancellation fee for all 3 !!! I complained because they basically took money from me and did not do anything but put my $2 to my uber account. I did not want to use uber anymore so I wanted a refund back into my bank account and they refused to do that. UBER TAKES PEOPLES MONEY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE USES THIS APP
Tracking me when the app is off isn't allowed. I don't care if it's only for five minutes. How many updates are going to go by until this is fixed?

Still location tracking? Is it really worth the horrible ratings?
I typically use Uber for running late to work or events, safe rides, and quick trips in inclement weather and, close to 100% of the time, the drivers are on time, super friendly, professional and have great taste in music. I highly recommend Uber to anyone looking for a safe, convenient and fairly priced ride. 👌
Yes, we need to enable location services for Uber to work properly. But why does it always need to know where we are? Please add a "while using the app" option for location. I am forced to turn on/off the "always" every time I use uber.
Tried to get a ride to the train the other day. Was supposed to arrive in 3 min.  Forward 15min and the ride says 1min away for 13min.  Because it is so close I cannot cancel without penalty. I was gonna miss my train ...
I left the request open and eventually got charged. Ridiculous!
I haven't had any trouble or issues with the app.  Works great everywhere I've gone and used it.
I was recently in Boston and had the choice to use Uber or Lyft. When I have this choice it's almost always Lyft. I used a Lyft 9 times. And an Uber...not at all. Why? Because Uber is in the dark ages in terms of what passengers want. I want to avoid dealing with cash. But your app won't let me do that!! It's my choice whether or not to tip and I want to do that without sorting out cash in the dark and perhaps over or under-tipping.  PLEASE FIX THIS. Thanks.
Bloated app, probably filled with software that tracks your every movement and avoids lawful monitoring of their service. 

This latest update is 273 MB. Why?

Time to slim down that app!!
Third time in a row where my ride has stopped at the wrong part of a block or intersection. This doesn't happen when I use Lyft's app.
While the rest of the apps are half the size... please streamline your app...
Uber app tracks you location even if you are not using it. Combining this with the todays report that uber tried to track your identity even after you deleted its app in 2015, I can clear see that this is a really shady company.

Latest update (may 15) still has all or nothing for location privacy setting. Really terrible.
Service is fine. 
App is bloated beyond all reason...
Have installed and reinstalled but quits before open screen. Works ok on iPhone so what gives?
How does a $54 ride end up being a $68 ride? For some reason, Uber likes to choose the longest and unnecessary route. Please fix this asap.
Removing until tracking can be set to while using app again. I travel for work, and spend hundreds a month on ride sharing. That money is going to lyft or taxis until the invasive tracking stops.
I've had two instances of unsuccessful refunds where the app says I will be refunded and it never happened, multiple weeks later. Surge prices are also continually on when I try to go to ride. Have had better experiences with Lyft, the main competitive advantage of Uber was cheaper prices and now that's gone too.
Apple Pay never works. 
Invades Privacy. 
Shady drivers. 
Up charges regularly. 

I'd rather hitchhike.
I'm all for advancement of the application and I loved the scheduling feature but the icon is now missing in this latest version. I just used it a few weeks ago. There is literally no way to schedule a pick up.
I used uber to work every day with my prepaid card and loved it and I only found out recently that they don't allow them so they stopped my card from going through, and Lyft is too expensive so now I'm forced to take the bus...thanks uber
I am disabled. They gave me LiNK driver, had an Ubber driver 2day. He was nice enough. I left my keys in his car. 
Wen he picked me up tho, a phone number appeared 
(602) 883-5673. Needed 2 call him back after drop off because I left my keys in his car. Wen I called that #, the message came back with a WHOLE other number and area code as the call back. 
Something ain't ryte. 
Don't trust Ubber!  I styll don't have my keys. I might get raped or worse. 
My name is Beryl Brockington, 2day is Saturday, May 13th, and I used Transportation of IEHP at 4:40pm       

and I am scared 4 my life.
Have ridden Uber on about 5 occasions. My last ride, the Uber driver jumped out of the car at me and tried to throw a punch at me. There is no support for this to get in touch with somebody from Uber immediately. You have to go through several support options in the app until they validate that your issue is worthy enough to provide you with a phone number for you to reach them. After contacting my local law enforcement and submitting a "report" within the app, I received a call from Uber an hour after the incident for the issue with which they claim to take seriously. I will no longer be using this service or any other of this type as there is no regulation as to who gets hired to perform the work. Use ride sharing at your own risk.
I don't know why but for some reason when I close off the app from not being able to connect to a ride it still puts me through a few minutes later after failed attempts without me noticing …For example i tried to reach out to lyft for the first time from a failed über connection and it wasn't until the end of the ride I noticed that über was the one who dropped me off please fix this issue I feel it will cause Unnecessary ride cancelations fees thanks
1. My Apple Pay NEVER works. I keep getting greeted with a payment error every time I reopen my app to request a ride. 
2. It's no longer easy to change the contact number thru the app. I now have to call and then manually key in my number before I can actually get transferred to the driver. This is a problem because it wastes a LOT of precious time when you need to direct the driver or if they pass you by. Why did you remove that feature?
Anything from trying to access my contacts to always tracking my location.

I'm done with uber and their scummy practices.
Literally no customer service "only a help section that just messages you some automated answer than marks it as resolved" won't accept most payment methods including their own uber credit half the time....I have my PayPal and $50 credit still yet %50 of the time I still get "payment failed method". Considering the account balance and it only happening half the time. I can only blame this app. USE LYFT!!!
I've had Uber drivers call me several times asking if I'm going to a specific area, and when I tell them no they ask me to cancel the ride. That is rude and unprofessional, and when I try leave a review it only brings up the driver who actually took me where I needed to go. I will be using lyft from now on. They have never asked me to cancel and have always been kind.
The app is glitchy. The wait times are terrible. Unreliable, got unmatched with drivers after 15 min+ wait. Bad customer service. I only use it when I literally have no other option.
Save time and headache and just use use Lyft
Uber Black driver cancelled on me twice after confirming I was going to synagogue. Said his tire pressure gauge went off so he had to cancel... why accept the second time around?
Uber app works all day then tonight it says my app is out of date and I can't request a ride until I update. Well... the app is too large to update unless your on wifi so we were stranded until I could find a restaurant with wifi. Not cool Uber.
I have been Uber for quite sometime now. And I enjoy it. I have met some amazing people via Uber. 
But recently, Uber is behaving like a teenage girl on period. It keeps on charging me cancellation so many times, even if the estimated time for driver to arrive is too long. I almost missed an interview because of the driver and loosing 2$ on top of it, just made it even more sour.
Wow, I was waiting for my uber and he didn't even show up. But i was charged $75 for a ride I didn't take. I asked for a refund but they said no and the driver arrived to your destination. But i didn't even ride the freaking uber. Bad company. I'll use lyft from now on.
Everytime I order uber to go home, Uber's system always takes the drivers to somewhere behind the apartment complex where I live, to a completely different street. It's really annoying. Please fix it.
If you're happy having the app crash consistently and being over charged regularly - then this is the ride service for you. Thank goodness there are other options. Very poor and inconsistent customer service.
Uber has been great in that it revolutionized how we get around. BUT if you ever have an issue with your account or a ride it is nearly impossible to contact someone at uber. There is one phone number listed online and that just refers you to the app. What happens when your account gets hacked and you get locked out? I emailed through their help section online, I messaged them on Facebook and Twitter but still no response after an hour. This is completely unacceptable, unsafe, and irresponsible. Uber needs a true help line.
After one of their drivers sent me to the wrong location, I was still charged. I tried to reach out to customer service to fix the problem and was met with nothing but condescension. I'm never using this app again.
Need to fix the app
My battery is almost dead, I need to make it to an appointment within the hour, uber app hasn't even downloaded halfway and it's been 20 minutes. I downloaded the Lyft  app within a few seconds so it's not just the Apple Store or service in my area, or any other factor. Why does it take you so long to download, Uber? I'm annoyed.
I download the app despite what many reviews say and it won't accept any method of payment. I tried over 3 different cards and wow none of them apparently work! This app is ridiculous and a complete waste of my time.
Give back all the money I paid you!!!!
Hate this update made it worse then it already was.. Drivers still don't follow the GPS right. I always got to look at their GPS and tell them when and were to turn.
They blocked me in the country that i livein coz i said my opinion on a bad driver !!!
Please fix your issues with the system, this is ridiculous
Terrible terrible. Never has service and always unable to load due to being "too busy at this time"
The app is very limited; cannot even retrieve your password if you forget it. 
And now - it keeps trying to update, and it crashes - so it's completely unusable. Even tried deleting it, to reinstall it - but does not even allow you to delete it!!!  You can press delete all you want, it confirms, then does nothing!  Still "reinstalling " for the last 3-4 days!!
I think that uber is handy. When I can't catch the bus or I'm running late it's a nice option to have. What I don't appreciate is that when I request an uber if I cancel after 5 min. I still get charged, but if a driver cancels after 5 mins. what I ask happens to them? They've wasted my time and now I have to spend time trying to get another uber. Which in some cases makes me even more late than I already am. I understand that me being late is nobody else's problem. But at the same time if I'm stranded somewhere on a cold night this can also be the case. I find that the cancelation fee for customers reduces the amount of people who cancel on their driver. So what will be done about the driver who cancels on the customer?
Uber app these days, garbage. Long waits for price, constantly changing car arrival times ie: starts 5 mins, then after 5 mins its 8 mins, then 3 mins, 8 again.... I know Boston traffic is constant & a joke.... but this should include that?
So I spend 10-20 mins just looking for it.
Prices for X ALWAYS $5-8 more than last spring/summer -yet they claim only 1 small increase? Fares in general higher A LOT! Leave from same place every night & no surge mentioned but fares will vary like Sunday pool $6.99, Monday $11.50, Tues $7, Wed $11.89???? Why?
Then they put out a Flat Fare program, then take it away, put it out, take it away, have us do an hour long survey on them & put out new program.. and take it away...
seriously??  Change the zone for Boston Flat Fares to stop 3 blocks from where I go EVERY DAY IN BOSTON (W Rox) & don't tell you -but it covers Cambridge & Brookline????
Also -I believe these wealthy companies should pay employees excellent wages OF COURSE & hate that so many squeeze the little guy -but its so uncomfortable on 85-90% + of my Uber rides the drivers are talking about their pay (10% happy enough, 90% complaining) & the lack of tips.... its so awkward!
Anyway, Uber needs to get on it or my 1-5 rides a day are done!!
My debit card's expiration date changed, I updated it in the app. Then in the app- Repeated "invalid payment method". I even added an entirely different form of payment- no luck. 
Customer service is no help. Not worth the nonsense. Moved to Lyft.
App is ok, but 1). I will never allow my location to ALWAYS be monitored, but wouldn't mind allowing this while I use the app only.
2). The app is missing an obvious feature: I cannot delete a payment option. If it's there and I'm missing something, please let me know.
Why is only use my location "only while using the app" no longer available? Leaving a one star reviews until you restore this.  I used to use Uber all the time but now I only use it when there are no other options.
Awesome service and quick pick up
1st time we tried there was a creepy Asian dude he was sooo  quiet it was weird, second time 
was a super chill 50 year old dude so it's a win win cause you still get where you wanna go (unless you get murdered) 😂
The app takes you to longer ways instead of relying on the Waze technology that indicates traffic and problems. 
Also, if you're going to the airport with a family of 5 and lots of luggage, beware; Uber does not allow you to pick a Minivan so good luck finding a car that fits everyone and everything. And if you cancel it because no one fits; then you get charged.
I just updated my app and now I can't login in due to a error that it saids ! Annoying
I always have an issue driver always gets lost since townhouses are new in my complex and apartments are in the back they never see my apart # displayed in their gps.
On a normal ride from downtown to my apartment is $22 but on one Thursday night that didn't seem very busy they charged me $88. The driver was very nice which is why I gave them 2 stars but I will never use uber again. I'll try lyft and go back to taxis before using this app again.
Using every day in Kyiv, Ukraine.
Yeah... I tried using uber but it was difficult for me to even close my account so I just deleted the app and switched to @lyft 🚗SO MUCH happier
Advices for the Uber App:

-Uber needs to create a chat where drivers and customers can text before the pickup, since not all the locations are on the uber search bar, and not everyone has minutes to call.

-Uber needs to let their customers share location. For example, if I'm a 13 year old kid without an uber account on my phone and my mom needs someone to pick me up. I should have the chance to share my location through "SMS" or through "WhatsApp" so can my mom could open it on uber just in case she doesn't know the exact location.

-Uber should not charge almost 2 dollars for cancelling 5 minutes after requesting, that's not right. If I don't like the uber that is picking me up, because for some reason the car is broken, the guy seems annoyed, the guy is a creeper..etc. Guys you should take that out for good.

-Uber isn't supposed to be like  other taxi's. Is meant to have a superior quality, in other words, the driver must have qualities that could enrich Uber's image. Uber should make a long quiz for those who want the job, and ask for their ID in case they are banned. If there are at least 3 customers complaining for a specific driver, that driver should be fired. 3 Strikes, you out.

-Uber should correct a bug that makes the driver seem he/she is 15min away, mean while actually he/she is 5min away.
I've used this app across the U.S. and in Las Vegas last year. This go-round was by far the worst. I stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau one block off the strip. Every time I asked for an Uber, it kept wanting me to move across the street to the Hilton Vacation hotel. Very disappointing. I rather pay the extra money for an old fashion taxi. I've lost confidence in the app after struggling for 4 days...
Don't waste your money or your time. This company not only rips off us customers but, the contracted drivers as well!
Worst App Ever  never install it
I have tried over 10 times to get someone in customer support to actually help me but they all send me canned statements that they copied and pasted from their how to help a customer guides. Don't even bother...try Lyft instead and leave Uber behind. Here is what I am trying to get them to help me on and the messages I sent them. 

Hello, I used Uber for the first time yesterday and my payment for my first ride went through. Now I'm having issues with my second ride I took a couple of hours later. I tried using the help feature on the app and so far I have had 6 different ppl message me back and it looks like none of them coordinate with anyone so they are all stepping over each other. I want to make sure the driver gets paid and I have already contacted my bank and they said that there is no issue on their end. Please help me make it right to the driver!!  He was very nice and I want to make sure he gets the payment promised to him. 

Please help!!!!!
Service is ok, but control over the customers is excessive. I used to pay for my rides in both the US and Mexico using apple pay on my iphone (my account is US based). Now it doesn't work in Mexico anymore, forcing me to enter my credit card info because Uber purposely blocked it based on location. That's an unnecessary and excessive control over the customers. Apple Pay is just a credit card payment, and users based in a country where apple pay is already available should still be allowed to use it in any other country they travel to. It does not matter whether apple pay is supported in that other country or not, because even if it's not, apple pay will still be recognized by the local payment system as a valid credit card. I can prove that because I used it in Mexico just fine until Uber purposely blocked it based on location. Since then, I get an error "apple pay not available in this region" when I request a ride in Mexico and choose apple pay as payment. I don't like being controlled that way.
Does not work with newest Ipad. Useless
Never Uber before and was in my first car in 5 minutes from the time I decided to go. And that included downloading the app and entering all the info!
I have Narcolepsy (when you fall asleep and can't control it) and was told that I no longer should be driving.  The same day I found that out I got a promo for flat fares for $4.99.  I almost cried with excitement! I used Uber twice or more almost everyday.  Uber has made my life so much safer!  Sending a BIG THANK YOU to Uber! ❤️
THIS IS THE WORST APP I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!!!  I WAS STUCK OVER 45 MINUTES BECAUSE IT CLAIMED I OWED MONEY WHICH I DIDN'T!!!  ENDED UP USING LYFT!!  NO customer service!!!  Will never use again!!!!
Y'all is scrubs and don't let under 18
Stop tracking people 24/7. Add the option to only use my location when using the app back again. I only use Lyft now because of this.
(or any other payment) for last night's ride, and won't let me order another ride. Lyft works fine, and allows me to add a tip.
I used to love the app. A few days ago I was saying that something I loved about uber was that the showed you and made clear that the price was higher when it was. Now you took that away and I dont trust you as much. Also in my city the map doesn't correspond with the address. As a solution I suggested the app should let you send a note to the driver automatically with the uber request, but nothing. I hate the update
The driver is always on time, price is reasonable, and every driver I've gotten has been really cool. That's saying a lot considering how many times I've used it. I've never had any issue with this app.
For existing accounts where a user lost access to email which can happen hen internet acounts get black listed ouber needs to accept the phone number of the cell phone that's calling in the email field and then send a verification text and have that user enter theverification code then check to see if the device is in the account location before alowing a new email address and password to be set up for the account.  Ouber might warn the user they must be in their home location before starting any of this process and if the user responds that they are in the original home location from which they got their first ouber ride then ouber should compare current location against oriinal location and if the two differ send out a stolen device report to Apple and local policee with current device location. If the locations match, and the text verification is successful then get an email address and password from the user and then update their account with those two fields.
There is absolutely no reason to have location tracking forced to be "always". This is unacceptable and needs to be changed. Need to activate the "while using" gps option
Charge me multiple times when the app shows request failed and then messages me a uber is arriving without anything on the app. Another time, I request a uber and the driver never shows up and charges me $50 for the trip. I contact the company by explaining I was not ok the car by proving my credit card transactions at the train station when I was 'sitting in the uber' and the final destination was not even the one I requested. Still, after their 'close look', they believe it is a 'legit ride'. Stupid company!
every time I update the app it gets worse. the app doesn't let you know if the prices are higher than usual, they just charge you more and don't tell you you could be paying less. the same ride on my updated app was pricier than in my sister's older version. thankfully we now have cabify in my city and now I don't have to deal with this horrible service
The app is simple to use, but I don't care to have the GPS on at all times even when I'm not using the app. I turn of on and off between use, and it becomes a hassle.
So its happened more than once that Ive requested a driver, get notified of having one and then five minutes later get notified they dropped me and its searching for yet another driver. Then sometimes the driver wont even show up for thirty minutes when it tells you Five. So then you cancel. And then you get charged. For literally nothing of your own fault. Im still trying to dispute two trips like that. Reputations going down, and the app is getting worse. Luckily most of the drivers are good people.
It seems every time I update something changes and makes it more difficult to use the app. I frequently use it while I'm in DC and have found it hard to use in a hurry because things are changing all the time.
I stopped using Waze for the same reason and I'm not going to share my location all the time with Uber either.
I updated it now (first minute) and realized not changed.
168 MB for an update? You gotta be kidding me.
Location is either on or off. Uber does not give you the location option "when using app". Then I read even when you delete the Uber app, Uber still creepily tracks you.  Use Lyft, the good guys.
It works OK, but the app consumes 160 MB of RAM (plus 8 MB of my data).  This is a big chunk of memory if your phone only has 16 GB.
Travel all over the place and uber is my go to. Safe, reliable and makes cities accessible!
Why uber needs location permission as always? While not using app though it should not use the current location
Absolute garbage app.  The Las Vegas airport has a designated pick up spot that our driver refused to find.  He then canceled our ride after we waited 20 minutes.  At this point, surge pricing tripled the cost of the ride and we ended up taking a taxi.
Our second attempt to use the app left us wandering around looking for an address because the app couldn't figure out where we were and considering all the trouble we had the first time we said forget it and downloaded the Lyft app.  Literally in less than 3 minutes had the Lyft app set up, promo code in, pick up location automatically loaded with special instructions and we had less than a 4 minute wait until our driver arrived.  The GPS on the uber app is trash.  Really disappointing.  Oh and the first driver who refused to pick us up at the airport tried to charge us a cancellation fee.  Although, Uber did refund it.
When I try to request a ride, the app would say request failed. Then 15 minutes later when I'm already on a bus, tell me my driver is arriving. Charges me $5 for canceling. Absurd and infuriating.
Even when you uninstall the app
Haven't used it yet but here's my promo code: naomien38ui
Let's start with how there is no number to call and Uber Support is utterly useless since we get no reply for a day or two. Next I constantly received an error in which it did not say what exactly was wrong with the ride request. After trying a couple more times, then it says there was an error with the card. Keep in mind it tells me this AFTER I tried a couple more times while receiving the useless error code. So I went on the website and my card did not meet any of the requirements that would point to a dull credit card. So I tried another card, you know, another working card and it still does not work. DO NOT RIDE UBER.
I'm completely done with Uber as a whole. They've now charged me for multiple rides that I never took (they were in different states 1000's of miles away) and refuse to refund me. More so, I was charged $70.99 for a flat rate $29.00 ride. I reached out to them multiple times and they never responded. Their customer service is appalling. Changing to Lyft.
I was skeptical of uber when it launched. I didn't like that they would skirts laws and alienate cab drivers. Then I tried it a few times and liked that they made efforts to work with local government to "update" the law. Then recently they are just a steaming pile of ....  noticing but problems. To make it worse they charged my Visa three times for "rides" that I never took in a state I haven't been to in many months. Fraud. I'm sure many people don't notice because these are under $10 charges that look innocuous. Thanks for "revolutionizing" the taxi industry. Can't wait until you join the tech graveyard.
Awful. The app will change waiting times like crazy. Instead of being picked up in 6 minutes you get picked up in 16-20. Not good when you have places to be at very specific times.
He second an app demands my location even when that window is closed, it gets uninstalled. Sorry but no, it's none of your business where I am uber. Go data mine someone else.
One of their drivers was talking to me in an inappropriate way and every sexual. I reported the driver and then my account was disabled and I emailed them and they kinda infer that it was my fault. Never using this company again.
I used the first ride coupon in London.  App worked fine but the £18 off coupon did not. I wrote to them but no response. Then when I used Uber in the US, they gave me a $18 discount for a $12 ride, for which I can expense for work.  Thanks for nothing!
The quality of accidents go down the drain after your Uber driver gets into an accident and you are screwed
I can't even begin to count the amount of times I've been late because of my uber taking some round about way to get me to work. I shouldn't have to pay attention to my drivers route to. Ale sure they're not going 10min out of the way. What's sad is I'm currently writing this in the back of an Uber that's just made me late for work.
Uber driver canceled my request after he was unable to find the pickup location, that he drove by 3 times while I was waving at him to flag him down, once while I was on the phone with him. I was then charged $5 for the cancellation. Uber says they do that when the driver had to wait more than 5 minutes. The driver never even stopped! The next driver I requested found the pickup location with zero problems. Uber customer service is refusing to refund the cancellation fee.

Between their pathetic customer service, and a string of bad, unsafe drivers, their privacy issues, and the ethics of this company, I'm done with this.
Last time I used the service the driver took at least four wrong turns costing me an extra $15 on an already expensive ride. 
Along with the misogynistic corporate culture I can no longer support this cesspool of a company. Lyft, here I come!
They take longer then an a cab and sometime even more expensive then
I got the app cause my car broke down and I needed to get to work. Turns out the drivers don't know where you are headed until they either ask you through text beforehand or arrive to your house. Both guys cancelled on me for some reason.
Requested an uber so I could get to work. App told me the uber had arrived so I went downstairs only to find that he wasn't outside, but rather on another street going the opposite direction. I called several times with no answer so I decided to just cancel the ride since after waiting seven extra minutes, I was now running late. They charged me a cancellation fee that they refused to refund onto my card, stating that it was "credited to my account," even though I explained the situation. Then they had the nerve to say that the discussion was "closed." 

Long story short: I was late to work and lost $5 for something that wasn't my fault. Thanks, uber.
